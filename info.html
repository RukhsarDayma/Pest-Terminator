          Mouse (plural: mice) is a small rodent characteristically having a
          pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high
          breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse
          (Mus musculus). It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain
          kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes
          for food and shelter.Mice, in certain contexts, can be considered
          vermin which are a major source of crop damage, causing structural
          damage and spreading diseases through their parasites and feces. In
          North America, breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse
          excrement has been linked to hantavirus, which may lead to hantavirus
          pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Primarily nocturnal animals, mice compensate
          for their poor eyesight with a keen sense of hearing, and rely
          especially on their sense of smell to locate food and avoid predators.
          Mice build intricate burrows in the wild. These burrows typically have
          long entrances and are equipped with escape tunnels or routes. In at
          least one species, the architectural design of a burrow is a genetic
          trait.

          <h2>Fleas</h2>
          <img class="lfloat" src="images/fleas.jpg" alt="Flea" />
          Fleas are small flightless insects that form the order Siphonaptera.
          As external parasites of mammals and birds, they live by consuming the
          blood of their hosts. Adults are up to about 3 mm (0.12 in) long and
          usually brown. Bodies flattened sideways enable them to move through
          their host’s fur or feathers; strong claws prevent them from being
          dislodged. They lack wings, and have mouthparts adapted for piercing
          skin and sucking blood and hind legs adapted for jumping. The latter
          enable them to leap a distance of some 50 times their body length, a
          feat second only to jumps made by froghoppers. Larvae are worm-like
          with no limbs; they have chewing mouthparts and feed on organic
          debris. Over 2,500 species of fleas have been described worldwide. The
          Siphonaptera are most closely related to the snow scorpionflies
          (Boreidae), placing them within the endopterygote insect order
          Mecoptera. Fleas arose in the early Cretaceous, most likely as
          ectoparasites of mammals and marsupials, before moving on to other
          groups including birds. Each species of flea is more or less a
          specialist on its host animal species: many species never breed on any
          other host, though some are less selective. Some families of fleas are
          exclusive to a single host group: for example, the Malacopsyllidae are
          found only on armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats, and the
          Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews. The oriental rat flea,
          Xenopsylla cheopis, is a vector of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium
          which causes bubonic plague. The disease was spread by rodents such as
          the black rat, which were bitten by fleas that then infected humans.
          Major outbreaks included the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death,
          both of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world’s population.

          <h2>Bed Bugs</h2>

          />
          Bed bugs are parasitic insects of the cimicid family that feed
          exclusively on blood. Cimex lectularius, the common bed bug, is the
          best known as it prefers to feed on human blood.The name bed bug
          derives from the preferred habitat of Cimex lectularius: warm houses
          and especially near or inside beds and bedding or other sleep areas.
          Bed bugs are mainly active at night, but are not exclusively
          nocturnal. They usually feed on their hosts without being noticed. A
          number of adverse health effects may result from bed bug bites,
          including skin rashes, psychological effects, and allergic symptoms.
          Bed bugs are not known to transmit any pathogens as disease vectors.
          Certain signs and symptoms suggest the presence of bed bugs; finding
          the adult insects confirms the diagnosis. Bed bugs have been known as
          human parasites for thousands of years. At a point in the early 1940s,
          they were mostly eradicated in the developed world, but have increased
          in prevalence since 1995, likely due to pesticide resistance,
          governmental bans on effective pesticides, and international
          travel.Because infestation of human habitats has begun to increase,
          bed bug bites and related conditions have been on the rise as well.
          <h3 class="alert">
            Bed bug treatment comprises of treating the all places where the bed
            bugs may be hiding. On beds, Mattresses (mattress buttons) as well
            as the folds at the edges, Cracks and crevices in walls, bed frames,

          <h2>Cockroaches</h2>
          <img class="lfloat" src="images/cockroach.webp" alt="A cockroach" />
          Most species of cockroach are about the size of a thumbnail, but
          several species are bigger. The world’s heaviest cockroach is the
          Australian giant burrowing cockroach Macropanesthia rhinoceros, which
          can reach 9 cm (3.5 in) in length and weigh more than 30 g (1.1 oz).
          Comparable in size is the Central American giant cockroach Blaberus
          giganteus, which grows to a similar length. The longest cockroach
          species is Megaloblatta longipennis, which can reach 97 mm (3.8 in) in
          length and 45 mm (1.8 in) across.[19] A Central and South American
          species, Megaloblatta blaberoides, has the largest wingspan of up to
          185 mm (7.3 in). The body is divided into a thorax of three segments
          and a ten-segmented abdomen. The external surface has a tough
          exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner
          organs and provides attachment to muscles. It is coated with wax to
          repel water. The wings are attached to the second and third thoracic
          segments. The tegmina, or first pair of wings, are tough and
          protective, lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings,
          which are used in flight. All four wings have branching longitudinal
          veins, and multiple cross-veins. The three pairs of legs are sturdy,
          with large coxae and five claws each.They are attached to each of the
          three thoracic segments. The front legs are the shortest and the hind
          legs the longest, providing the main propulsive power when the insect
          runs. The spines on the legs were earlier considered to be sensory,
          but observations of the insect’s gait on sand and wire meshes have
          demonstrated that they help in locomotion on difficult terrain. The
          structures have been used as inspiration for robotic legs. The abdomen
          has ten segments, each with a pair of spiracles for respiration.
          Segment ten bears a pair of cerci, a pair of anal styles, the anus and
          the external genitalia. Males have an aedeagus through which they
          secrete sperm during copulation and females have spermathecae for
          storing sperm and an ovipositor through which the ootheca is laid.

          <h2>Termite</h2>
          <img class="lfloat" src="images/termite.jpg" alt="A Termite" />
          Owing to their wood-eating habits, many termite species can do great
          damage to unprotected buildings and other wooden structures. Their
          habit of remaining concealed often results in their presence being
          undetected until the timbers are severely damaged, leaving a thin
          layer of a wall that protects them from the environment. Of the 3,106
          species known, only 183 species cause damage; 83 species cause
          significant damage to wooden structures. In North America, nine
          subterranean species are pests; in Australia, 16 species have an
          economic impact; in the Indian subcontinent 26 species are considered
          pests, and in tropical Africa, 24. In Central America and the West
          Indies, there are 17 pest species. Among the termite genera,
          Coptotermes has the highest number of pest species of any genus, with
          28 species known to cause damage. Less than 10% of drywood termites
          are pests, but they infect wooden structures and furniture in
          tropical, subtropical and other regions. Dampwood termites only attack
          lumber material exposed to rainfall or soil. Drywood termites thrive
          in warm climates, and human activities can enable them to invade homes
          since they can be transported through contaminated goods, containers
          and ships. Colonies of termites have been seen thriving in warm
          buildings located in cold regions. Some termites are considered
          invasive species. Cryptotermes brevis, the most widely introduced
          invasive termite species in the world, has been introduced to all the
          islands in the West Indies and to Australia. In addition to causing
          damage to buildings, termites can also damage food crops. Termites may
          attack trees whose resistance to damage is low but generally ignore
          fast-growing plants. Most attacks occur at harvest time; crops and
          trees are attacked during the dry season.
          <h3 class="alert">
            One should carry out timely inspection of termites as they thrive
            and prosper on our living spaces. We utilise the modern scientific
            method of treatment for Anti Termite (White Ants) treatment with
            powerful pesticides, termite chemicals are filled regularly in the
            exteriors area till the whole walls are soaked absorbed with the
            chemicals, that is why we do the only one major treatment of the
            white ants at the root and we are only company who is utilizing
            Seepage canes which is permanent solution (this method used only our
            company in the whole Mumbai) of the white ants, we give 1/3/5 years

          <h2>Wasps</h2>
          <img class="lfloat" src="images/Paper-wasp.jpg" alt="A wasp" />
          A wasp is any insect of the order Hymenoptera and suborder Apocrita
          that is neither a bee nor an ant. The Apocrita have a common
          evolutionary ancestor and form a clade; wasps as a group do not form a
          clade, but are paraphyletic with respect to bees and ants. The most
          commonly known wasps, such as yellow jackets and hornets, are in the
          family Vespidae and are eusocial, living together in a nest with an
          egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured
          by the unusual haplodiploid system of sex determination in
          Hymenoptera, as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each
          other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each
          adult female living and breeding independently. Many of the solitary
          wasps are parasitoidal, meaning that they raise their young by laying
          eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult). Unlike
          true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts. Solitary
          wasps parasitize almost every pest insect, making wasps valuable in
          horticulture for biological pest control of species such as whitefly
          in tomatoes and other crops. Wasps first appeared in the fossil record
          in the Jurassic, and diversified into many surviving superfamilies by
          the Cretaceous. They are a successful and diverse group of insects
          with tens of thousands of described species; wasps have spread to all
          parts of the world except for the polar regions. The largest social
          wasp is the Asian giant hornet, at up to 5 centimetres (2.0 in) in
          length; among the largest solitary wasps is a group of species known
          as tarantula hawks, along with the giant scoliid of Indonesia
          (Megascolia procer). The smallest wasps are solitary chalcid wasps in
          the family Mymaridae, including the world’s smallest known insect,
          with a body length of only 0.139 mm (0.0055 in), and the smallest
          known flying insect, only 0.15 mm (0.0059 in) long. Social wasps are
          considered pests when they become excessively common, or nest close to
          buildings. People are most often stung in late summer, when wasp
          colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for
          sugary foods and are more likely to come into contact with humans; if
          people then respond aggressively, the wasps sting. Wasp nests made in
          or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the
          wasps may sting if people come close to them. Stings are usually
          painful rather than dangerous, but in rare cases people may suffer
          life-threatening anaphylactic shock.
